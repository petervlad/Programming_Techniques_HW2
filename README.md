  The application should simulate a series of clients arriving for service,
entering queues, waiting, being served and finally leaving the queue. It
tracks the time the customers spend waiting in queues and outputs the
average waiting time. To calculate waiting time we need to know the arrival
time, finish time and service time. The arrival time and the service time
depend on the individual clients â€“ when they show up and how much service
they need. The finish time depends on the number of queues, the number of
clients in the queue and their service needs.

  The input data would be the minimum and maximum interval of
arriving time between customers, minimum and maximum service time, the
number of queues, the simulation interval.
